Now that you have gotten a brief  overview of what SST is. We are ready to build something with it and look its key concepts.

The following sections is a brief tutorial on how to build a full-stack app with SST. We'll start by creating a new SST app and set up our local development environment. This will also create the starter we'll be using. The starter includes a database, GraphQL API, and a React frontend.

The starter creates a very simple Reddit clone. You can submit links and it'll display all the links that've been submitted. We'll add a comments feature to our app.

To do this, we'll start by adding a new database table. Then we'll add an API to our GraphQL endpoint. Finally, we'll connect it to on our frontend. And deploy it to the world!

The entire tutorial should take less than an hour. We recommend going through it once to get a feel for how SST works.

Let's get started.
