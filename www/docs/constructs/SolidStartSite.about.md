The `SolidStartSite` construct is a higher level CDK construct that makes it easy to create an SolidStart app. It provides a simple way to build and deploy the app to AWS:

- The client assets are deployed to an S3 Bucket, and served out from a CloudFront CDN for fast content delivery.
- The app server is deployed to Lambda. You can deploy to Lambda@Edge instead if the `edge` flag is enabled. Read more about [Single region vs Edge](#single-region-vs-edge).
- It enables you to [configure custom domains](#custom-domains) for the website URL.
- It also enable you to [automatically set the environment variables](#environment-variables) for your SolidStart app directly from the outputs in your SST app.
- It provides a simple interface to [grant permissions](#using-aws-services) for your app to access AWS resources.

## Quick Start

1. If you are creating a new SolidStart app, create a `my-solid-start-app` folder at the root of your SST app.

Then run `create-solid` from the `my-solid-start-app` folder.

```bash
npx create-solid@latest
```

And make sure to enable `Server Side Rendering`.

![Select SolidStart App template](/img/solid-start/bootstrap-solid-start.png)

After the SolidStart app is created, your SST app structure should look like:

```bash
my-sst-app
├─ sst.json
├─ services
├─ stacks
└─ my-solid-start-app     <-- new SolidStart app
   ├─ src
   ├─ public
   └─ vite.config.ts
```

Continue to step 3.

2. Alternatively, if you have an existing SolidStart app, move the app to the root of your SST app. Your SST app structure should look like:

```bash
my-sst-app
├─ sst.json
├─ services
├─ stacks
└─ my-solid-start-app     <-- your SolidStart app
   ├─ src
   ├─ public
   └─ vite.config.ts
```

3. Let's set up the AWS adapter for your SolidStart app, since we will be deploying the app to AWS. To do that, make sure your `vite.config.ts` looks like the following.

```ts
import solid from "solid-start/vite";
import aws from "solid-start-aws";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [solid({ adapter: aws() })],
});
```

And add the `solid-start-aws` dependency to your SolidStart app's `package.json`.

```bash
npm install --save-dev solid-start-aws
```

:::info
If you are deploying the `SolidStartSite` in the `edge` mode, use the edge adapter instead.

```diff
- plugins: [solid({ adapter: aws() })],
+ plugins: [solid({ adapter: aws({ edge: true }) })],
```

:::

4. Also add the `static-site-env` dependency to your SolidStart app's `package.json`. `static-site-env` enables you to [automatically set the environment variables](#environment-variables) for your SolidStart app directly from the outputs in your SST app.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @serverless-stack/static-site-env
```

Update the package.json scripts for your SolidStart application.

```diff
  "scripts": {
-   "dev": "solid-start dev",
+   "dev": "sst-env -- solid-start dev",
    "build": "solid-start build",
    "start": "solid-start start"
  },
```

5. Add the `SolidStartSite` construct to an existing stack in your SST app. You can also create a new stack for the app.

```ts
import { SolidStartSite, StackContext } as sst from "@serverless-stack/resources";

export default function MyStack({ stack }: StackContext) {

  // ... existing constructs

  // Create the SolidStart site
  const site = new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
    path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  });

  // Add the site's URL to stack output
  stack.addOutputs({
    URL: site.url,
  });
}
```

When you are building your SST app, `SolidStartSite` will invoke `npm build` inside the SolidStart app directory. Make sure `path` is pointing to the your SolidStart app.

Note that we also added the site's URL to the stack output. After deploy succeeds, the URL will be printed out in the terminal.

## Single region vs edge

There are two ways you can deploy the SolidStart app to your AWS account.

By default, the SolidStart app server is deployed to a single region defined in your `sst.json` or passed in via the `--region` flag. Alternatively, you can choose to deploy to the edge. When deployed to the edge, loaders/actions are running on edge location that is physically closer to the end user. In this case, the app server is deployed to AWS Lambda@Edge.

You can enable edge like this:

```ts
const site = new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  edge: true,
});
```

Note that, in the case you have a centralized database, Edge locations are often far away from your database. If you are quering your database in your loaders/actions, you might experience much longer latency when deployed to the edge.

:::info
We recommend you to deploy to a single region when unsure.
:::

## Custom domains

You can configure the website with a custom domain hosted either on [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [externally](#configuring-externally-hosted-domain).

```js {5}
const site = new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  customDomain: "my-app.com",
});
```

Note that visitors to the `http://` URL will be redirected to the `https://` URL.

You can also configure an alias domain to point to the main domain. For example, to setup `www.my-app.com` redirecting to `my-app.com`:

```js {5}
const site = new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    domainAlias: "www.my-app.com",
  },
});
```

## Environment variables

The `SolidStartSite` construct allows you to set the environment variables in your SolidStart app based on outputs from other constructs in your SST app. So you don't have to hard code the config from your backend. Let's look at how.

To expose environment variables to your SolidStart application you should utilise the `SolidStartSite` construct `environment` configuration property rather than an `.env` file within your SolidStart application root.

Imagine you have an API created using the [`Api`](../constructs/Api.md) construct, and you want to fetch data from the API. You'd pass the API's endpoint to your SolidStart app.

```ts {7-9}
const api = new Api(stack, "Api", {
  // ...
});

new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  environment: {
    API_URL: api.url,
  },
});
```

Then you can access the API's URL in your server code:

```ts
const data = await db(import.meta.env.API_URL);
```

Note that, in SolidStart, only environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are available in your browser code. [Read more about using environment variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html).

For example, if you want to access the API's URL in your frontend js code, you'd name it `VITE_API_URL`:

```js
new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "path/to/site",
  environment: {
    VITE_API_URL: api.url,
  },
});
```

Let's take look at what is happening behind the scene.

#### While deploying

On `sst deploy`, the SolidStart app server is deployed to a Lambda function, and the SolidStartSite's `environment` values are set as Lambda function environment variables. In this case, `process.env.API_URL` will be available at runtime.

If you enabled the `edge` option, the SolidStart app server will instead get deployed to a Lambda@Edge function. We have an issue here, AWS Lambda@Edge does not support runtime environment variables. To get around this limitation, we insert a snippet to the top of your app server:

```ts
const environment = "{{ _SST_EDGE_SITE_ENVIRONMENT_ }}";
process.env = { ...process.env, ...environment };
```

And at deploy time, after the referenced resources have been created, the API in this case, a CloudFormation custom resource will update the app server's code and replace the placeholder `{{ _SST_EDGE_SITE_ENVIRONMENT_ }}` with the actual value:

```ts
const environment = {
  API_URL: "https://ioe7hbv67f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
};
process.env = { ...process.env, ...environment };
```

This will make `process.env.API_URL` available at runtime.

#### While developing

To use these values while developing, run `sst start` to start the [Live Lambda Development](/live-lambda-development.md) environment.

```bash
npx sst start
```

Then in your SolidStart app to reference these variables, add the [`static-site-env`](/packages/sst-env.md) package.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @serverless-stack/static-site-env
```

And tweak the SolidStart `dev` script to:

```json title="package.json" {2}
"scripts": {
  "dev": "sst-env -- solid-start dev",
  "build": "solid-start build",
  "start": "solid-start start"
},
```

Now you can start your SolidStart app as usual and it'll have the environment variables from your SST app.

```bash
npm run dev
```

There are a couple of things happening behind the scenes here:

1. The `sst start` command generates a file with the values specified by the `SolidStartSite` construct's `environment` prop.
2. The `sst-env` CLI will traverse up the directories to look for the root of your SST app.
3. It'll then find the file that's generated in step 1.
4. It'll load these as environment variables before running the start command.

:::note
`sst-env` only works if the SolidStart app is located inside the SST app or inside one of its subdirectories. For example:

```
/
  sst.json
  my-solid-start-app/
```

:::

## Using AWS services

Since the `SolidStartSite` construct deploys your SolidStart app to your AWS account, it's very convenient to access other resources in your AWS account. `SolidStartSite` provides a simple way to grant [permissions](Permissions.md) to access specific AWS resources.

Imagine you have a DynamoDB table created using the [`Table`](../constructs/Table.md) construct, and you want to fetch data from the Table.

```ts {12}
const table = new Table(stack, "Table", {
  // ...
});

const site = new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  environment: {
    TABLE_NAME: table.tableName,
  },
});

site.attachPermissions([table]);
```

Note that we are also passing the table name into the environment, so the SolidStart server code can fetch the value `process.env.TABLE_NAME` when calling the DynamoDB API to query the table.

## Examples

### Configuring custom domains

You can configure the website with a custom domain hosted either on [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [externally](#configuring-externally-hosted-domain).

#### Using the basic config (Route 53 domains)

```js {3}
new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  customDomain: "my-app.com",
});
```

#### Redirect www to non-www (Route 53 domains)

```js {3-6}
new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    domainAlias: "www.my-app.com",
  },
});
```

#### Configuring domains across stages (Route 53 domains)

```js {3-7}
new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName:
      scope.stage === "prod" ? "my-app.com" : `${scope.stage}.my-app.com`,
    domainAlias: scope.stage === "prod" ? "www.my-app.com" : undefined,
  },
});
```

#### Configuring alternate domain names (Route 53 domains)

You can specify additional domain names for the site url. Note that the certificate for these names will not be automatically generated, so the certificate option must be specified. Also note that you need to manually create the Route 53 records for the alternate domain names.

```js
import * as acm from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";
import * as route53 from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53";
import * as route53Targets from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53-targets";

// Look up hosted zone
const hostedZone = route53.HostedZone.fromLookup(stack, "HostedZone", {
  domainName: "domain.com",
});

// Create a certificate with alternate domain names
const certificate = new acm.DnsValidatedCertificate(stack, "Certificate", {
  domainName: "foo.domain.com",
  hostedZone,
  region: "us-east-1",
  subjectAlternativeNames: ["bar.domain.com"],
});

// Create site
const site = new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "foo.domain.com",
    alternateNames: ["bar.domain.com"],
    cdk: {
      hostedZone,
      certificate,
    },
  },
});

// Create A and AAAA records for the alternate domain names
const recordProps = {
  recordName: "bar.domain.com",
  zone: hostedZone,
  target: route53.RecordTarget.fromAlias(
    new route53Targets.CloudFrontTarget(site.cdk.distribution)
  ),
};
new route53.ARecord(stack, "AlternateARecord", recordProps);
new route53.AaaaRecord(stack, "AlternateAAAARecord", recordProps);
```

#### Importing an existing certificate (Route 53 domains)

```js {8}
import { Certificate } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";

new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    cdk: {
      certificate: Certificate.fromCertificateArn(stack, "MyCert", certArn),
    },
  },
});
```

Note that, the certificate needs be created in the `us-east-1`(N. Virginia) region as required by AWS CloudFront.

#### Specifying a hosted zone (Route 53 domains)

If you have multiple hosted zones for a given domain, you can choose the one you want to use to configure the domain.

```js {8-11}
import { HostedZone } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53";

new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    cdk: {
      hostedZone: HostedZone.fromHostedZoneAttributes(stack, "MyZone", {
        hostedZoneId,
        zoneName,
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

#### Configuring externally hosted domain

```js {5-11}
import { Certificate } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-certificatemanager";

new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  cutomDomain: {
    isExternalDomain: true,
    domainName: "my-app.com",
    cdk: {
      certificate: Certificate.fromCertificateArn(stack, "MyCert", certArn),
    },
  },
});
```

Note that the certificate needs be created in the `us-east-1`(N. Virginia) region as required by AWS CloudFront, and validated. After the `Distribution` has been created, create a CNAME DNS record for your domain name with the `Distribution's` URL as the value. Here are more details on [configuring SSL Certificate on externally hosted domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html).

Also note that you can also migrate externally hosted domains to Route 53 by [following this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html).

### Configuring the Lambda Function

Configure the internally created CDK [`Lambda Function`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda.Function.html) instance.

```js {4-8}
new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  defaults: {
    function: {
      timeout: 20,
      memorySize: 2048,
      permissions: ["sns"],
    },
  },
});
```

### Advanced examples

#### Using an existing S3 Bucket

```js {5-7}
import * as s3 from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3";

new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  cdk: {
    bucket: s3.Bucket.fromBucketName(stack, "Bucket", "my-bucket"),
  },
});
```

#### Reusing CloudFront cache policies

CloudFront has a limit of 20 cache policies per AWS account. This is a hard limit, and cannot be increased. Each `SolidStartSite` creates 3 cache policies. If you plan to deploy multiple SolidStart sites, you can have the constructs share the same cache policies by reusing them across sites.

```js
import * as cloudfront from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";

const cachePolicies = {
  buildCachePolicy: new cloudfront.CachePolicy(
    stack,
    "BuildCache",
    SolidStartSite.buildCachePolicyProps
  ),
  staticsCachePolicy: new cloudfront.CachePolicy(
    stack,
    "StaticsCache",
    SolidStartSite.staticsCachePolicyProps
  ),
  serverCachePolicy: new cloudfront.CachePolicy(
    stack,
    "ServerCache",
    SolidStartSite.serverCachePolicyProps
  ),
};

new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site1", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  cdk: {
    cachePolicies,
  },
});

new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site2", {
  path: "another-solid-start-app/",
  cdk: {
    cachePolicies,
  },
});
```

#### Protecting server function behind API Gateway

When deployed to a single region, instead of sending the request to the server function directly, you can send the request to API Gateway and have API Gateway proxy the request to the server function. With this setup, you can use features like authorizers to protect the server function.

```js
import { Fn } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import * as origins from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront-origins";

const api = new Api(stack, "Api");

const site = new SolidStartSite(stack, "Site", {
  path: "my-solid-start-app/",
  cdk: {
    distribution: {
      defaultBehavior: {
        origin: new origins.HttpOrigin(Fn.parseDomainName(api.url)),
      },
    },
  },
});

api.addRoutes(stack, {
  "ANY /{proxy+}": {
    type: "function",
    cdk: {
      function: site.cdk.function,
    },
  },
});
```
